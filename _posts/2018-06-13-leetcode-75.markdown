## Problem Information

> * Link: [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)
> * Source: LeetCode
> * Difficulty: Medium
> * Description:

```
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

Note:

* A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
* First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
* Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## Solution
* This solution should be two-pass algorithm. I go through the list and for every point, switch it with the previous point until it is no less than the previous point or until it reach the start.


## Complexity Analysis
Time complexity: O(N^2). Space complexity: O(1).

## Edge Case
Haven't thought of other edge cases.

## AC Code

``` python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        
        if len(nums) == 1:
            pass
        
        else:
            for i in range(1, len(nums)):
                while nums[i] < nums[i - 1] and i > 0:
                    nums[i], nums[i - 1] = nums[i - 1], nums[i]
                    i -= 1
            
```

## Solution
To complete with the one-pass algorithm later.

## AC Code

``` python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        
            
```
