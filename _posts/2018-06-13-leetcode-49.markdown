## Problem Information

> * Link: [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)
> * Source: LeetCode
> * Difficulty: Medium
> * Description:

```
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

Example:

Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

Note:

* All inputs will be in lowercase.
* The order of your output does not matter.

## Solution
* Use list to resort the word, make sure letters are aligned in the same order (Set should also work for this case)
* Use dictionary to categorize, key as letter combination, value as a list including all acceptable words.

## Complexity Analysis
Time complexity: O(N). Space complexity: O(N).

## Edge Case
1. Empty input?
2. Haven't thought of other edge cases.

## AC Code

``` python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        if not strs:
            return [[]]
        
        ana = {}
        
        for word in strs:
            letters = list(word)
            letters.sort()
            letters = ''.join(letters)
            
            if letters in ana.keys():
                ana[letters].append(word)
            else:
                ana[letters] = [word]            
            
        return list(ana.values())
            
```
